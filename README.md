# Express-store-
## We ran a small experiment with one of our grocery partners with three variants:

1. Variant 0: A control group, which had the normal online shopping experience, without the express store enabled.
2. Variant 1: users were offered an express store option on the store selection page. The express store has a narrower selection than the full grocery store, but we guarantee faster delivery times. This faster ETA is integrated into the entire customer journey, from the store selection page through the checkout page.
3. Variant 2: which was also offered the express store and were additionally allowed to check out with a $10 basket size as opposed to our standard minimum basket size of $35. 

The Analysis showed the effect of each experiment on total spend
